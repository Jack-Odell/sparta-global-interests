# 'My Interests' Website

## Assignment

I was tasked with creating a website with more than one page, linked together, with the theme of one of my interests. I chose to video game music as my theme.

## Process

I used HTML and CSS only in the project. I wanted the page to stand out visually so I experimented with bold colours to make the text content on the landing page stand out and give it a 'gaming' vibe.

On the gallery page I embedded music players from _bandcamp.com_ to showcase some of my favourite music.
